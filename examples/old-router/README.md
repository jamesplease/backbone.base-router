# Old Router

This re-implements something similar to a standard Backbone Router. But it's better,
because it gives you your named params as an object and parses the query string for you.

### Running the example

This example depends on `node-static`. Install it via

```sh
$ npm install -g node-static
```

Now make sure that you've installed the dependencies for the project.

```sh
$ npm install
```

From the root directory **of this repository**, run `static`. Then navigate your browser to:
